***Sensnake - Snakes Sense!***

Sensnake is yet another Snake iteration, the player controls the ever-growing snake, that elongates each time the player eats a food chunk,- a resource that increases the player score, speeds up the game and displays snake bitmaps upon consumption.

**What's so special about it?**

Nothing really when it comes to the substance of the very game itself, but my most crucial task when working on this project was to provide my personal assistance for the potential code reviewer, by including the vast number of annotations. To code is generously described and is ready to be compiled with the documentation-generating service, such as Doxygen.

**How much have I learnt during the process of developing the app?**

Not much about the programming itself, as I already knew most of the stuff before, but I now know that I should always comment my code for clarity, not only for the comfort of another programmer, but also for my own - rambling through the old code is now very easy and intuitive, which is rarely the case when analyzing the old non-described code.

**Sources**

Aside from the code snippets taken from StackOverflow, I also followed the wpf-tutorial.com course (link provided below). I used similar formula for some parts of the code, but it only served as an ispiration. My code implements many mechanics, that vastly improve the quality of the game as compared to their installment.
